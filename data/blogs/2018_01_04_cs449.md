What’s the difference between UI and UX?
---

[Link](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2016/04/27/ui-vs-ux/)

**User interface** (UI) is the series of screens, pages, and visual elements — like buttons and icons — that you use to interact with a device.

**User experience** (UX) is the internal experience that a person has as they interact with every aspect of a company’s products and services.

UX isn’t limited to the visual interface of your product. It’s a concept that has many dimensions and encompasses the entire journey a person takes, including:

- The process they go through to discover your company’s product
- The sequence of actions they take as they interact the interface
- The thoughts and feelings that arise as they try to accomplish their task
- The impressions they take away from the interaction as a whole


What is Mobile First Design?
---

[Link](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/mobile-first-design)

Start the product design from the mobile end which has more restrictions, then expand its features to create a tablet or desktop version.

**Progressive Advancement** means that when we design a product, first we build a version for relatively lower browser (like that on a mobile phone). This version includes the most basic functions & features.

**Graceful Degradation** starts the product design from an advanced end like desktop and builds a version with well-rounded features at the beginning. Then designers make the product compatible to mobile ends by cutting some functions or contents.

Why "Mobile First" Principle?
---

1. Mobile internet usage has surpassed desktop usage in 2016.
2. People have spent more and more time on internet from mobile ends.
3. Early in 2012, smart phone sales have overtaken PC sales.


Lecture 2

[Art of Innovation | Guy Kawasaki](https://youtu.be/Mtjatz9r-Vc)

1. Make meaning
2. Make mantra
3. Jump to the next curve
4. Roll the DICEE (Deep, Indulgent, Complete, Elegant, Emotive)
5. Don't worry. Be crappy.
6. Let 100 flowers blossom
7. Polarize people
8. Churn
9. Niche thyself
10. Perfect your pitch


Understand your users
---

**User groups** is a set of characteristics based on general statistics.

**Persona** is a fictional character based on specific statistics.

Personas are important for:

- Building empathy and relating to users
- Communicating design goals
- staying focused of design goals
- supporting decision-making

The concept of persona is developed by **Alan Cooper**. 


Why you only need to test with 5 users
---

**Summary**: Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford.


Ethics
---

Principles:

- Respect for human dignity
- Respect for free and informed consent
- Respect for vulnerable persons
- Respect for privacy and confidentiality
- Respect for justice and inclusiveness
- Balancing harms and benefits
- Minimizing harm
- Maximizing benefits

User studies includes observation, registering features, and asking questions.


Validity of Research Design
---

| External Validity | Internal Validity |
|:----------------- |:----------------- |
| Size of the sample| Consistency of instruments|
| Time of the study | Reactivity |


Reactivity includes:

- Hawthorne effect
- Expectancy effect
- Conformity effect
- Social desirability effect


Exploratory Study includes:

- Motivational system
- Contextual knowledge & beliefs
- Cognitive model


Two types of Survey questions: **closed-ended** and **open-ended**.

Closed-ended questions include:

- Multiple choice
- Matrix
- Scales (semantic differential or likert scale)

Open-ended questions include:

- Unstructured
- Explanation
- Completion
- Association

Four types of Interviews: structured, semi-strctured, narrative, focus-groups.

| Structured | Semi-structured | Narrative | Focus-Groups |
|:---------- |:--------------- |:--------- |:------------ |
| Same set of questions | List of guiding questions | Focus and goal guide the discussion | Semi-structured in a group |
| Standardized process | Trajectories in a conversation | Open-ended questions | Moderated |
| Little freedom of expression | Often preceded by observation | Freedom of expression & little control | 6-10 homogeneous strangers |
| Often self-reported | One of the most popular | Popular in ethnography | Emerged in the 1940s |


Lecture 4
========

**Diary/Camera studies** includes a mechanism to record / describe relevant activities in "everyday" setting.

**Participatory Design** (inclusive design process) is to construct ideal expereince real time with a researcher.

Ethnographic field studies:

- Natural environment, everyday life
- First-hand participation in users’ activities
- Description of the scene, key events, key actors, key artifacts and actions
- Combination of observations and interviews
- Focus on objective behaviours

Contetual Inquiry:

- Relatively short (several hours)
- Researcher heavily involved in the process and constantly asks questions
- Mostly rely on self-report data


Translating Needs into Functionalities
---

**Make data actionable**

1. Adjust personas
    - make them more colorful and detailed based on the generalized characteristics of your participants you did not account for previously
2. Affinity Diagrams
    - A sense-making tool for qualitative data (Notes on cards -> Review the cards -> Sorting & grouping -> sub-groups -> Themes in data)
3. Breakdowns
    - Where and when things go wrong in individuals work practice
    - Points in time or space when individuals have a problem accomplishing the task that should otherwise be easy given the tools that they are using
    - Unpacking the tacit dimension for possible design solutions
4. Cultural model
    - includes influencers (bubbles), extent of influence (overlap of bubbles), influences (arrows), and breakdowns
5. Artifact models
    - physical objects that support the work (created and/or used in the process)
    - sketch or photo
    - complete with comments and notes on
        - structure
        - related purpose and tasks
        - functionality


Lecture 5
========

**Identify right time and place**

1. Physical model
    - physical work environment (plan)
    - includes:
        - Structures that limit and define space
        - Walls, desks, file cabinets, etc.
        - Hardware, software, communication tools
        - Artifacts and their location in relation to each other
2. Sequence model
    - Sequence of work steps and the intention behind steps
    - includes:
        - Intent behind step
        - Triggers, that initiate sequence
        - Steps, ata high level of details (actions, not movements)
        - Loops and branches showing order and iteration
        - Breakdowns (where things go wrong)
3. Flow model
    - Directions of communication and coordination
    - Defines how work is broken up across people and how people coordinate
    - Includes:
        - Interviewee (circles)
        - Other groups (circles)
        - Physical/virtual places (usually rectangles)
        - Artifacts as they pass between people
        - Breakdowns (where things go wrong)


Lecture 6
===

**Turn problems into tasks**

1. Thinking
    - Dual Process theory (two sided)
    - Cognitive load
        - Steps (least amount of work possible)
        - Choices (clear differences, limit # of choices)
        - Information (Progressive disclosure, provide examples, easy to scan)
    - Anticipate mistakes (avoid error-prompt tasks)
    - Perception biases (expectations determine perception)
    - Age, socioeconomic, status, cognitive abilities influence decision making
2. Memory
    - Perception - stroage - retrieval
    - Recognition rather than recall (pratice - recency - context)
    - People can remember ~3-4 items at a time
    - Zeigarnik effect 
        - interupted tasks are easier to remember (depends on the importance of the interrupted task for the person)
3. Attention
    - Focused attention is limited and selective
    - Inattentional blindness
    - Surface (awareness of features) and Content attention (awareness of information)
    - Attention is dynamic - allow hierarchy
4. Motivations
    - Tension from unmet needs (based on formed expectations)
    - Work must be meaningful
    - Reward wisely
    - Desire to belong to a group
    - In-group/out-group biases
5. Habituation
    - Pavlov's conditioning
    - Skinner's operant conditioning (with reinforcement)
    - Based on formed patterns
    - Creating new habits: stimulus - response; breaking the pattern


Lecture 7

Create design ideas
---

**Create Ideas**

Creativity is the process of producing a new idea which has value to someone

Generating ideas: memories -> ordinary -> extraordinary

Creative Process:

1. Preparation
    - Define the constraints such as goals, parameters of the challenge, resources, and time
    - Knowledge and understanding around the challenge: both academic and casual
    - Challenge all the assumptions
2. Provocation
    - Overcoming associative limitations
    - Design Fixation
    - Concept of po by Edward de Bono
    - Force of habits
    - Framing and reframing problems
3. Incubation
    - Mindful procrastination can sometimes be helpful
    - Different aspects of creativity require different brain activity
    - Most ideas are formed subconsciously
4. Eureka moment
    - An idea that might solve the challenge is pushed to the conscious level
    - Usually difficult to explain how you came up with this idea
    - Always write it down in the moment no matter what
5. Verification
    - All ideas are rough when they are first visualized - get through the criticism
    - Be optimistic, give your crazy ideas a chance
    - No right answers, only working solutions
6. Realization

**Design**

Interface is a surface/place where two independent systems, bodies or spaces meet / form a common boundary, and communicate with each other. Interface is also a communicaion channel.

Communication is exchanging of information

Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols

Sign is anything that communicates a meaning which includes:

- Repesentamen (signifier) - the form of the sign
- Interpretant - what people make of the sign
- Object (signified) - the actual referecne of the sign


Design process:

1. Signifier
    - indicators of any type that communicate the action needed so the affordance can take place
2. Affordance
    - the possible use for an object when interacting with it
3. Constraints
    - restrictions that limit the possible actions available with an object
    - Physical - caused by physical features
    - Cultural - based on what is culturally accepted
    - Semantic - based on the meaning of the situation
    - Logical - use reasoning to determine the alternatives
4. Feedback
    - conveys effects of user's actions
        - Location: where am I?
        - Current status: what's happening?
        - Future status: what's next?
        - Outcomes: what just happened?
        - Time: how long is it going to take?
        - Reasons: why you do what you do?
        - Presence: are you even there?
    - Feedback loop:
        - Speed: Influence decisions
        - Context: meaning of your feedback
        - Measurability: provide comparison
        - Motivation: should correspond
5. Discoverability
    - whether it's possible to figure out how to use an object by interacting with it
        - findability - whether it's easy to find content
        - learnability - whether it's easy to learn how to use functionality
6. Mapping
    - indication of the relationship between objects
        - make use of spatial gestalt principles
        - in some cases culture-specific
        - build around existing mental models
7. Conceptual Model
    - user's understanding of how the system works
        - successful product -> user's mental model = designer's conceptual model


Lecture 8
===

Gibson's Affordances:

- Offerings or action possibilities in the environment in relation to the action capabilities of an acotr
- Independent of the actor's experience, knowledge, culture, or ability to perceive
- Existence is binary - an affordance exists or it does not exist

Norman's Affordances:

- Perceived properties that may or may not actually exist
- Can be dependent on the experience, knowledge, or culture of the actor
- Can make an action difficult or easy



Lecture 9
===

Information Architecture - structural design of shared information environments

Knowledge Organization

- Taxonomy
    - Practice of classification based on hierarchical relationship (i.e. parent-child hierarchies)
- Folksonomy
    - Practice of classification based on non-hierarchical relationship (i.e. public tags and their frquencies)
- Domain Analytics Approach
    - Practice of classification based on socialogical - epistemological view (i.e. women in computer science)

Closed Card Sort:

- Participants get a stack of cards
- Participants sort cards into groups the researchers created

Open Card Sort:

- Participants get a stack of cards
- Participants sort cards into groups
- Participants label groups


Prototypes

- interactive design model of the product
- i.e. low-fidelity and high-fidelity
- purpose: testing and evaluation


Low fidelity vs High fidelity:

- Breadth - number of covered features
- Depth - degree of functionality
- Appearance - building means
- Input methods - device mediation

Paper Prototypes:

- interactive
- lo-fi appearance / input
- hi-fi depth / breadth
- simulation of a back-end
- early feedback
- experiment with alternatives
- big picture focus
