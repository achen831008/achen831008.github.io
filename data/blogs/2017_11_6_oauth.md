Authentication and Authorization
========================

**Authentication** is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data claimed true by an entity.

**Authorization** is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.

[Session Hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking) occurs when an attacker gains access to a users session cookie and can make requests upon their behalf.

- Keep auth scopes minimal
- Limited/Restricted internet access
- Different auth requirements
