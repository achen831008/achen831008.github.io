Setting up:

```{r}
# get current working directory
getwd()

# set working directory to path
setwd('/Users/alexchen/achen/Projects/EDA')

# read csv data to statesInfo
statesInfo <- read.csv('stateData.csv')
```


Creating a subset from dataset:

```{r}
# get subset of statesInfo where state.region equals to 1
stateSubset <- subset(statesInfo, state.region == 1)
# or statesInfo[statesInfo$state.region == 1,]

# print first two row
head(stateSubset, 2)
```

Run this next command to load the mtcars data:

```{r}
data(mtcars)
```

To see summary of data:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

The **str()** and **summary()** functions are helpful commands when working with a new data set.

The str() function gives us the variable names and their types.

The summary() function gives us an idea of the values a variable can take on.


> In 2013, the average mpg (miles per gallon) for a car was 23 mpg.
The car models in the mtcars data set come from the year 1973-1974.
Subset the data so that you create a new data frame that contains
cars that get 23 or more mpg (miles per gallon). Save it to a new data frame called efficient.

```{r}
efficient <- subset(mtcars, mpg >= 23)
```

> How many cars get more than 23 mpg? Use one of the commands you
learned in the demystifying.R to answer this question.

```{r}
dim(efficient)[1]
```

> We can also use logical operators to find out which car(s) get greater than 30 miles per gallon (mpg) and have more than 100 raw horsepower.

```{r}
subset(mtcars, mpg >= 30 & hp > 100)
```

There's only one car that gets more than 30 mpg and 100 hp.

> Print the cars that have a 1/4 mile time (qsec) less than or equal to 16.90 seconds to the console.

```{r}
cars <- subset(mtcars, qsec <= 16.90)
row.names(cars)
```

> If weight of car < 3, set weight class to ligiht. If weight of car >= 3 and < 3.5, set weight class to average. Else, set it to heavy.

```{r}
mtcars$wt
cond <- mtcars$wt < 3
cond
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')
mtcars$weight_class
cond <- mtcars$wt > 3.5
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)
mtcars$weight_class
```
